The purpose of decenter.world is to:

- Create an overview of the decentralized systems that are forming,
  starting with the Bitcoin whitepaper and inital version of the software
  in 2009
- Separate actually running systems and their properties from future promises and hype

Secondary goals:

- Gradual introduction to decentralized systems
- Bootstrapping knowledge about decentralized systems to allow people
  to more quickly ramp up in the area they're interested in
