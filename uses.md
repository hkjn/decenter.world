# Store of value

Money has a long history for humanity.
Money should have certain properties like

being scarce and fungible, and is used
in certain ways, like medium of exchange,
store of value, and unit of account.

Bitcoin is as of yet not great as medium
of exchange or unit of account, but it
can be exchanged, although with high delay,
but it is already great as a store of value. 
# Speculative investments

ICOs of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum have as of Q3 2017 led to $3B+ investments, with
varying innovation in financial terms.
