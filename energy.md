# Energy usage of Bitcoin

Bitcoin uses energy to secure the transactions in its blocks, by incentivizing miners to spend
electricity solving the PoW puzzles.

The use of this energy to secure Bitcoin is a cost, which is sometimes misunderstood. Since the
miner that uses a more expensive energy source would lose out and go out of business compared
to the one that used cheaper energy, it really is a bounty on how cheaply energy can be generated,
and allows excess energy that couldn't be effectively used in manufacturing or homes to be
used in mining.

Nic Carter describes this well:
"Bitcoin is an energy sponge, and it monetizes inefficiencies like excess wind when the grid
doesn't want it, or stored water in dams when it has to be let out, or solar super far away
from population centers. This is why I consider bitcoin synthetic energy. It not only
monetizes those inefficiencies, but it also incentivizes the construction of cheaper energy
generation. Its time and space-indifferent properties make formerly impractical stuff like
solar or wind more viable. And it's a $12.4b dollar annual subsidy for cheap energy installation.

Bitcoin is a colossal battery that absorbs energy and then releases it anywhere, whenever. Far
from being a waste of energy, it's a tremendous opportunity for society to build a better, more
efficient energy grid."
