# Mining

- Some dis-economies of scale show up with mining, but more economies
- So mining facilities are centralized risk points for Bitcoin
- Someone could seize control of facility, and use the hash power
  to attack the network
- One idea gmaxwell has been working on is ASICs with knowledge of
  their owner's keys, and directing consensus vote work needs to
  be signed with owner's keys
- This idea would make physical control of facility less of risk,
  since owners could be far away physically from the facility and
  just turn their hardware off
- Buying and maintaining small fraction of hashrate by central banks,
  countries and large economic players in Bitcoin would allow more
  decentralization
