# Mining

- Economic priniciple of mining: commodity price of mining is where
  miners would be willing to spend up to current market price of Bitcoin
  to mine it
- If PoW is switched to PoS or something else, that economic interest
  will flow there instead, to buy political favors, influence the
  committee that hands out new coins or similar
- Might not be bad that commodity costs comes with production
  costs (mining hardware)
- If block size is lowered, then larger mining pools have larger
  advantage over smaller ones; 10 min is quite conservative, but
  e.g. 5 sec would be too low for PoW consensus across entire network,
  and would introduce many more orphan blocks
- Some dis-economies of scale show up with mining, but more economies
  of scale
- So mining facilities are centralized risk points for Bitcoin
- Someone could seize control of facility, and use the hash power
  to attack the network
- One idea gmaxwell has been working on is ASICs with knowledge of
  their owner's keys, where directing consensus vote work needs to
  be signed with owner's keys
- This idea would make physical control of facility less of risk,
  since owners could be far away physically from the facility and
  just turn their hardware off
- Buying and maintaining small fraction of hashrate by central banks,
  countries and large economic players in Bitcoin would allow more
  decentralization
