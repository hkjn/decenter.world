# Sidechains 

Security provided by sidechains is different than Bitcoin itself

## Security

- Miners attacking main Bitcoin chain lose out on transaction fees, and
  can only doublespend (mine their own transaction, then reorg by
  mining a longer chain)
- Sidechains are SPV wallets from main chain's perspective, which means
  that attacks can steal coins on sidechain, not just double-spend them
