# Problem: Bitcoin is subtle and complex

For example, the scaling debate from 2014 â€” 2017 focused almost
entirely on block size, while size of UTXO set is more relevant,
and basic game theoretic roles of developers, users (with or
without fully validating nodes), merchants/exchanges and miners.

One relevant dimension is what users are doing with Bitcoin:

- Short-term speculators: Want whatever causes price to go up right now
- Transacting: use Bitcoin for payments, want low costs
- HODLers: Ability to validate their own coins

Idea: Have set of "levels of knowledge", where concepts from basic to
advanced are taught interactively, and 100% understanding is verified
Khan Academy-style and issued as vanity icon like "level 3 Bitcoin user",
maybe written to blockchain.

## Push system
