# Consensus

## Proof of Work (PoW)

Spent physically scarce resources to put lower bound on thermodynamic effort to rewrite history. Issue native
tokens of the network to those spending those resources.

## Proof of Stake (PoS)

Select set of validators based on their existing ownership of network's token. Issue new tokens to those
validators.

Known to have fundamentally different security tradeoffs than PoW, so a new node or one that's been offline a long time
can't find the legitimate history without some centralized checkpointing mechanism akin to "ask a friend".

## Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

Somehow elect few dozen nodes which gets to produce blocks. Effectively consortium, where those with tokens get
to decide who the consortium is.

## Proof of Proof of Work (PoPoW)

Mathematically prove that you spent work. Research area with possible applications to sidechains.
