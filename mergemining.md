# Mergemining 

## Incentives

- Do you make more money attacking, or mining honestly?
- No extra hardware costs with mergemining, since capital already
  exists for Bitcoin mining
- Should assumption of 51% honest hashrate be enough, or should we
  require evidence of economic incentives is that miner majority _will_
  be honest?
